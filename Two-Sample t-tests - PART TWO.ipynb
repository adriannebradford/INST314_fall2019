    "Two sample t-tests of proportions can largely be conducted the same way as two-sample t-tests, using the same functions. For this we'll look back at the `small_gss` data, and the `abany` variable we looked at in the one-sample t-test examples.  This is a yes/no question regarding support for abortion.  Instead of comparing the mean of the entire sample to an external value (null hypothesis mean) we'll test the difference in means between males and females."
